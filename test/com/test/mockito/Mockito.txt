Mockito :
========
Mockito is a mocking framework, JAVA-based library that is used for effective unit testing of JAVA applications. 
Mockito is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be 
used in unit testing.

Stub : 
-----
Created a dummy class of some class which are not available for testing. 
Like ProductDAO are not available at the time of testing so we can create stub of that to test controller methods

In this case of something got change in method we might need to do some changes in stub

Mock : 
-----
Mocking is creating object that simulate the behavior of real objects.
Unlike stubs, mock can be dynamically created from code -at runtime.
Mock offer more functionality than Stubbing. 
You can verify method calls and lots of other things.

Example :
TodoService todoServiceMock = mock(TodoService.class);
List<String> todos = Arrays.asList("Learning spring", "Learning spring boot");
when(todoServiceMock.retrieveTodos("Dummy")).thenReturn(todos);

TodoBusinessImpl todoBusinessImpl = new TodoBusinessImpl(todoServiceMock);
List<String> filteredTodos = todoBusinessImpl
				.retrieveTodosRelatedToSpring("Dummy");
assertEquals(2, filteredTodos.size());


Use when().thenReturn() to assign values in mock object


BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)
----------------------------------
Given - When - Then 


Spy :
-----
Instead of dummy object it gives a real kind of object. But still we can some stub in it.
But not recommended because it create confusion to developers.

Better to use Mock then Spy
